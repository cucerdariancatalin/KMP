# KMP
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm is a string matching algorithm used to find the occurrence of a pattern string in a text string. It uses a preprocessing step to create a failure function to improve efficiency, making the KMP algorithm faster than other basic string matching algorithms.
